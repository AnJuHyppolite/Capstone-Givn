        Givn is an educational app that encourages and incentivizes users to
        give away their unwanted goods instead of throwing them away. Anyone 
        can easily post their unwanted goods in seconds and allow others nearby 
        to find and receive those goods. Users will receive points for each item 
        they give away and will be presented with educational facts about the 
        benefits of recycling each item. Top givers will be eligible for prizes.
        <br />
        <br />
        What sets Givn apart from popular platforms like Craigslist and 
        Facebook Marketplace is that our app is distinctly focused on giving away
        stuff for free that would otherwise go to waste. Our app 
        helps users get rid of their stuff and promotes the preservation of our 
        planet with educational facts about the benefits of waste minimization.

            I am a software engineer and teaching artist who uses theater arts,
            poetry, and playwriting to design curricula and facilitate workshops
            through inquiry-based, healing-centered social equity pedagogy for
            New York City youth and adults. My interests lie at the intersection
            of the arts, tech, and social equity. I am passionate about
            designing products that help communities thrive, especially during
            times of need.
            <br />
            <br />
            My experience and artistic scope make me a quintessential asset to
            any communications, performance, educational, or technology team. I
            love working collaboratively and find great satisfaction working as
            a team to see a project through from start to finish.

            Programming has always been a passion of mine. Fascinated by the
            world of video games, my journey began at a young age when I would
            research game design and the different working aspects that come
            together for users to enjoy. This fascination led me to the
            wonderful world of programming.

            I am a Full Stack Developer at Pursuit, fascinated by creating an
            application that would benefit other people in different countries.
            Back home in the Philippines, people are struggling with pursuing
            their education due to a lack of resources. Therefore, I decided to
            pursue Software Engineering to help the less fortunate get
            jump-started on their careers. Through Pursuit, I gained my skills
            includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, React/Redux,
            PostgreSQL, Sprints, Agile, Code Reviews, and Pair Programming.
            Pursuit, an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship
            with a 9% acceptance rate.
