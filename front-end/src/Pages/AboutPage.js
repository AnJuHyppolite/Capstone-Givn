      <p>
        Givn is an educational app that encourages and incentivizes users to
        give away their unwanted goods instead of throwing them away. This
        simple app will allow anyone to easily post their unwanted goods and
        allow others to find and receive those goods. Users will receive points
        for each item they give away and will be presented with educational
        facts about the benefits of recycling each item. Top givers will be
        eligible for prizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets Givn App apart from competitors like trash nothing!,
        Craigslist, Listia, and Facebook Marketplace, is that while our app
        helps users get rid of their stuff and aid in preserving the planet, it
        also provides education about the benefits of waste minimization.

            Programming has always been a passion of mine. Fascinated by the
            world of video games, my journey began at a young age when I would
            research game design and the different working aspects that come
            together for users to enjoy. This fascination led me to the
            wonderful world of programming.

            After successfully gaining my CompTIA A+, CompTIA Security+, and
            CompTIA Linux+ certifications from NPower, I became a Tech
            Professional. I was also selected as a Fellow at Pursuit, an
            intensive 12-month software engineering fellowship with a 9%
            acceptance rate, where I am currently building my repertoire in
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many more. My end goal is to become a
            video game programmer!

            When I am not working or learning, I enjoy completing Sudoku puzzles
            to keep my mind active as well as, of course, video games such as
            Rocket League, Animal Crossing, and Tetris 99! If you're interested
